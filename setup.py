        "# voice\n_______\n\nHello! If you came across this library, you probably tried to implement "
        "voice functions with [interactions.py](https://github.com/interactions-py/library), "
        "but that was not possible, since it natively does not support voice.\nBut don't worry! With "
        "`voice` you can do exactly that! We not only add the `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE` event but also the "
        "ability to connect to voice channels and transmit audio.\n\nThis will be a basic guide on "
        "how to install and use this library.\n\n## "
        "Installation\n_________________________________________________________\n\n```bash\npip "
        "install -U interactions-voice\n```\n\n## But what exactly is this library and what does it "
        "do?\n_________________________________________________________\n\nThis library is an "
        "extension for `interactions.py`, what gives it the ability to connect to voice and send data "
        "and to \nlisten to the ``voice_state_update`` event.\n\n## Example "
        "usage:\n__________________\n\n```python\nfrom interactions import CommandContext, "
        "Channel\nfrom interactions.ext.voice import VoiceState, VoiceClient\n\nbot: VoiceClient = "
        'VoiceClient(token="...")\n\n@bot.event\nasync def on_voice_state_update(vs: VoiceState):\n   '
        ' print(vs.self_mute)\n    ...\n\n@bot.command(name="connect", description="...", '
        "options=[...])\nasync def connect(ctx: CommandContext, channel: Channel):\n    await "
        "bot.connect_vc(channel_id=int(channel.id), guild_id=int(ctx.guild_id), self_deaf=True, "
        'self_mute=False)\n    await bot.play(file="C:/...")\n```\n',
